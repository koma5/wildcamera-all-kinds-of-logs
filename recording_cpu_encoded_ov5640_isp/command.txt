# color is off because there's still this frame start error with this camera. And there is a shiftet area which is cropped by the ISP atm.
# this is fixable and not present in other cameras. The timestamps are off. Why it plays too fast in mpv.
# vlc is refusing to play it... for the same reason I think. But nice first recorded, encoded moving picture. =)
